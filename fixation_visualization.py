"""
Visualize eye-tracking fixations overlaid on target polygon stimuli.

All trials are identical across participants, so the same trial can be compared
across sessions. The module exposes three visualization modes:

    - plot_single_subject(session_folder, target_trial)   one subject, one trial
    - plot_aggregated_subjects(root_dir, target_trial)    all subjects, one trial
    - plot_multi_trials(root_dir, ...)                    several trials, side by side

Fixations can be drawn as a scatter or as a density heatmap, and the multi-trial
mode can lay out either all rotations of one polygon, or all variations (steps)
of one vertex-count at a fixed rotation.

Time synchronization between the EyeLink clock (ASC file) and the experiment
clock (CSV) is performed using the first ``TRIAL_START`` sync message.

    Fit a bivariate normal distribution to the (x, y) fixation coordinates.

    Uses numpy.mean for the center and numpy.cov for the covariance, then derives
    the confidence-ellipse geometry from the eigen-decomposition of the
    covariance matrix (eigenvectors give the axis directions, eigenvalues their
    variances).

    Orientation in a full 0..360 framework
    --------------------------------------
    An eigenvector's sign is arbitrary, so the bare major-axis angle is only
    defined modulo 180 deg -- which makes line graphs of orientation vs polygon
    rotation 'wrap' and break beyond 180 deg. To recover a true 0..360 reading we
    anchor the major-axis direction to the displacement vector from `ref_point`
    (the stimulus original centroid) to the fixation mean: the major eigenvector is
    flipped to point into the same half-plane as that displacement, then atan2
    yields a sign-preserving 0..360 angle.
